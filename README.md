# CodeGAN

Todo-List

- [x] Implement sampling method of Generator (RelGAN) - noise / first letter
- [ ] Improve Discriminator - proposed by Nie et al. - CNN
- [ ] Enable Temperature tuning during training
- [ ] Test: Run the combinations on a bigger (but still small) test data set / Maybe in google colab with free gpu? Proof of Concept
- [ ] Implement alternative Sampling
- [ ] Implement WassersteinLoss
- [ ] Integrate GPT2 Generator (?)
