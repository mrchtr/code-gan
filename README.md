# CodeGAN

Todo-List

- [x] Implement sampling method of Generator (RelGAN) - noise / first letter
- [x] Improve Discriminator - proposed by Nie et al. - CNN
- [x] Enable Temperature tuning during training
- [x] Apply different tokenization strategies
- [ ] Add pretraining phase for generator
- [ ] Apply different tokenizier - code2vec, ...
- [ ] Test: Run the combinations on a bigger (but still small) test data set / Maybe in google colab with free gpu? Proof of Concept
- [ ] Implement alternative Sampling - based on Context? 
- [ ] Implement WassersteinLoss - see Paper for Details
- [ ] Integrate GPT2 Generator (?)
